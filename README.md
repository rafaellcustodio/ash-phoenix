# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Ash + Phoenix LiveView codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://realworld-ash.fly.dev/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Ash** + **Phoenix LiveView** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Ash** + **Phoenix LiveView** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> A fullstack phoenix liveview application with backend built with [Ash Framework](https://ash-hq.org/).

# Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

# Sending a Pull Request
The consultants at Alembic are monitoring for pull requests when they are “on the beach” (aka when they are not billable or working with a client). We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. For changes raised when there are no consultants on the beach, please expect some delay. We will do our best to provide update and feedback throughout the process.
